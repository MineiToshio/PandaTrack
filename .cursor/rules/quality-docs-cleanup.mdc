# Quality, documentation, and cleanup – PandaTrack

## Linter

Address all linter warnings. When disabling a rule is necessary, add a comment explaining why.

```typescript
// Using any because the external library does not expose types
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
const data: any = externalLib.getData();
```

## Comments

Code should be self-explanatory. Comment **why**, not what.

- Non-obvious business logic
- Workarounds for bugs or limitations in external libraries
- Optimizations that might seem counterintuitive
- Regex patterns and their purpose
- TODO comments when something is left pending: `// TODO: description`

## Utilities in src/lib or src/utils

For functions in `/lib` or `/utils` used across the project, add JSDoc when it helps clarify the contract (parameters, return value, edge cases). Use descriptive names that explain what the function does.

## Cleanup

- Remove unused code: variables, functions, and dependencies
- Remove unused imports
- Remove commented-out code that is no longer needed
