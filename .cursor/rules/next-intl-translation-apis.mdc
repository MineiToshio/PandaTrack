# next-intl translation APIs - PandaTrack

## Rule: use hooks in React components

In React components (pages, layouts, and shared components), prefer next-intl hooks:

- `useTranslations()`
- `useLocale()`
- `useMessages()`

This keeps components synchronous and consistent with typical React patterns.

## Rule: use server helpers outside React

Use next-intl server helpers only in non-React code or Next.js framework functions:

- `getTranslations()` for server-only utilities, helpers, and other modules outside React components
- `getTranslations()` in Next.js functions like `generateMetadata()` (and similar non-component entry points)

Avoid calling `getTranslations()` inside React components. If you are in a React component, use `useTranslations()` instead.
