# Project structure – PandaTrack

## Structure under `src/`

- **`/app`**: Next.js App Router pages and routes (includes `[locale]` and i18n).
- **`/components`**: Reusable components used across the app (e.g. `core/`: Button, Chip, Heading, etc.).
- **`/lib`**: Shared utilities: `prisma.ts`, `styles.ts` (cn), `constants.ts`, `fonts.ts`.
- **`/types`**: Global TypeScript definitions (e.g. `locale.ts`).
- **`/i18n`**: Internationalization messages and configuration.

## Domain / route-based organization

Code that is only used in one area of the app should live inside that area, not in global folders.

In PandaTrack:

- Routes under `src/app/[locale]/(landing)/` have their components in **`_components/`** within that route (e.g. Features, Hero, Menu, Section, UserFit).
- Route- or domain-specific hooks, actions, or utilities: use `_hooks/`, `_actions/`, `_utils/` folders within that route when they exist.

Rule: if a component, hook, action, or utility is only used in one specific area, place it inside that area’s folder structure, not in global `/components`, `/lib`, or `/hooks`.

## `_components` convention

Folders prefixed with `_` (e.g. `_components`) do not become route segments in Next.js. Use them to group code associated with a route or layout.
