# English-only code – PandaTrack

All source code and code-related output in this project must be written in **English**.

## Must be in English

- **Identifiers**: variable names, function names, type/interface/class names, constants, enum values
- **Comments**: inline comments, block comments, JSDoc, and any documentation in the codebase
- **Commit messages** and **branch names** (except ticket IDs)
- **Log messages**, **error messages**, and **developer-facing strings** in source code
- **Test names**, **describe/it blocks**, and **assertion messages**
- **API error messages or developer-facing response text** in code (user-facing copy goes to i18n)

## Exception: i18n (user-facing text)

User-visible text that is localized must **not** be hardcoded in components or server code. It must live in:

- `src/i18n/messages/{locale}/` (e.g. `en/`, `es/`)

The **keys** in those JSON files and the **content** of the translations may be in any language the product supports. Only the **code** (identifiers, comments, commits, logs, etc.) is required to be in English.

When adding or editing UI copy, add or update the corresponding keys in the appropriate locale files; do not put user-facing strings directly in TS/TSX.
