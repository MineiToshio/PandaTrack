      },
      {
        "question": "Will I see what I still owe?",
        "answer": "Yes. You get a clear view of remaining balances and upcoming payments by month, so pre-order payments don't catch you off guard."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about shipments?",
        "answer": "Track multiple shipments per order, carrier and tracking when available, and status: waiting at store, shipped, in transit, or delivered."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there reminders?",
        "answer": "You can set reminders to follow up on long pre-orders, prepare for upcoming payments, and nudge when a shipment goes quiet for too long."

      {
        "question": "Can I set a budget?",
